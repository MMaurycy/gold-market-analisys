## Project Description

This repository contains the R code and report for an integrated econometric analysis of the gold market, covering two distinct periods: 2013-2023 and 2023-2025. The study aims to investigate the impact of geopolitical uncertainty (GPR), economic policy uncertainty (EPU), and macroeconomic factors on gold price dynamics (returns and volatility).

The analysis employs various econometric methods, including Vector Autoregression (VAR), GARCH models (including GARCH-X), Structural VAR (SVAR), and Event Studies, to assess gold's role as a safe haven asset and understand the determinants of its price movements and volatility across the different periods.

The full description of the methodology, data, results, and discussion can be found in the main report PDF included in this repository.

## Input Data

The analysis requires specific input data files (CSV, XLS) which **must be obtained by the user** and placed into the correct subdirectories within the `data/` folder.

* **Create the directory structure:** `mkdir data`, `mkdir data/Part\ I`, `mkdir data/Part\ II`

    * `Categorical_EPU_Data.xlsx`: Categorical Economic Policy Uncertainty Data (Source: policyuncertainty.com)
    * `data_gpr_daily_recent.xls`: Geopolitical Risk Index (Source: M. Iacoviello's Website)

**Note:** Some files (e.g., GPR, VIXCLS, DCOILWTICO, DFF, DTWEXBGS, USEPUINDXD) might be needed for both analysis parts and should be placed in *both* `data/Part I/` and `data/Part II/` directories if the scripts expect them there. Verify the exact file requirements and sources from the scripts and the main report.

**Crucially:** After placing the data, ensure the `data_directory` and `data_dir` variables within the R scripts in the `scripts/` folder point to the correct relative paths: `"data/Part I"` and `"data/Part II"` respectively.

## Requirements and Dependencies

* **R:** Version 4.x.x or higher recommended.
* **RStudio:** Recommended IDE.
* **R Packages:** The scripts attempt to automatically install missing packages. The required packages include:
    * **From CRAN:** `quantmod`, `xts`, `zoo`, `readr`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `readxl`, `tidyr`, `tseries`, `urca`, `rugarch`, `vars`, `svars`, `ggplot2`, `scales`, `patchwork`, `sandwich`, `lmtest`, `gridExtra`, `car`, `devtools`, `dygraphs`.
    * **From GitHub:** `eventstudies` (from repository `nipfpmf/eventstudies`, specific ref `v1.2.2`). `devtools` is required to install this.

## How to Run the Analysis

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MMaurycy/gold-market-analisys.git](https://github.com/MMaurycy/gold-market-analisys.git)
    cd gold-market-analisys
    ```
2.  **Create data directories:**
    ```bash
    mkdir data
    mkdir data/Part\ I
    mkdir data/Part\ II
    ```
3.  **Obtain and place data:** Download all necessary data files (as listed in the "Input Data" section) from their respective sources (FRED, Investing.com, policyuncertainty.com, M. Iacoviello's website) and place them into the corresponding `data/Part I/` and `data/Part II/` folders.
4.  **Verify paths in R scripts:** Open `scripts/gold_market_analisys_part1_2013-2023.R` and ensure `data_directory` is set to `"data/Part I"`. Open `scripts/gold_market_analisys_part2_2023_2025.R` and ensure `data_dir` is set to `"data/Part II"`.
5.  **Run the R scripts:** Open R or RStudio within the main repository directory (`gold-market-analisys`). Execute the scripts sequentially:
    ```R
    # Run analysis for Part I (2013-2023)
    source("scripts/gold_market_analisys_part1_2013-2023.R")

    # Run analysis for Part II (2023-2025)
    source("scripts/gold_market_analisys_part2_2023_2025.R")
    ```
6.  **Check Outputs:** Numerical results will be printed to the console. Plots should be saved to the `results/plots/` directory (assuming the save paths in the scripts have been updated, e.g., using `file.path("results", "plots", "filename.png")`). If plots are saved to the root directory by the original script code, they will appear there instead.
